In this dice game, players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points. The main rules are:

1. Players roll the die and add the rolled value to their turn score.
2. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and their turn score is lost.
3. Players can choose to "hold" their score, adding their turn score to their total score, and ending their turn.
4. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
5. The game can be reset at any time.
